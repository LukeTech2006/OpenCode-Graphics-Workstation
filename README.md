# OpenCode-Graphics-Workstation
An Operating System for Minecraft's OpenComputers, based on VSCode, Community Feedback and my other OS.

OpenCode aims to provide a VSCode-like experience for you to write software in different programming languages.

As of now, I will try to provide support for:
* Lua (low-level)
* FORTH
